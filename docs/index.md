# QuestMaster

QuestMaster is a platform for managing tabletop RPG games (e.g. D&D 5e), built for [Club JDR](https://club-jdr.fr).

It lets Game Masters create games with all the details — name, system, number of players, session dates — and lets players browse and register for them. The app integrates with Discord to automatically manage roles, channels, and notifications.

## Key features

- **Discord authentication** — users log in with their Discord account.
- **Game management** — GMs create and manage one-shots or campaigns.
- **Session tracking** — schedule sessions with calendar events.
- **Achievements** — trophy system for players and GMs.
- **Discord integration** — automatic role and channel management on the server.
